###Hey Everyone!!!!!!

My favorite Craigslist category is [Missed Connections](https://newyork.craigslist.org/d/missed-connections/search/mis 'The best place on the internet').

This is the first GitHub project I have ever done! It's my website consisting of projects I 
have done in my classes so far and I wanted to see where it goes! It will be made in GitHub for now
but I'm looking forward to hosting a webserver on my Raspberry Pi! Please enjoy the small projects that will
eventually be posted here!!!

Right now, I just finished my Intro to Java OOP class and I wanted to upload some of my class projects as well as my 
projects!! Currently, I'm teaching myself Python and C and trying to relearn HTML and CSS.  Hoping to also take a look at 
MySQL but this is subject to change depending on my classes! 

*******************BEWARE******************

Please note that right now this is just a demo website and it's subject to change!!!!!
